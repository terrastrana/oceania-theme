Oceania is a Tumblr theme inspired by clouds and the ocean.

A working example of the theme can be found at: http://oceania-theme.tumblr.com.

Notes for customizing the theme:

As you can see from the screenshots, there is an option to upload a header image. The ideal size for the header image is 560x378 pixels. 

There is an option to add your usernames from Facebook, Instagram and Twitter. I've included the social media icons for these three websites (facebook-96.png, instagram-96.png, and twitter-96.png). They will needed to be uploaded as Theme Assets in the Customize section.

You will also need to upload the background image pattern (included as swirl_pattern.png) to Theme Assets.

The theme template includes an option to add an about page to the sidebar navigation section of your theme. If you don't already have an About page, this link will be broken. To add an About page, click on Customize in the Dashboard, and scroll down to where it says "Add a Page." Make sure that your page URL is "about." (It should appear as http://yourblog.tumblr.com/about.) If you have advanced knowledge of HTML, feel free to modify the navigation and social media options.

If you are new to customizing Twitter themes, I would recommend that you make a backup of your existing Tumblr theme, before attempting to use this one.
